=====================================================

1 Introduction
------------
1. Definition
	Geography (from Greek γεωγραφία, geographia, lit. "earth description"[1]) is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth.[2] A literal translation would be "to describe or picture or write about the earth".
2. Origin of term
	The first person to use the word "geography" was Eratosthenes (276–194 BC).[3] 
3. Four historical traditions in geographical research
	+ spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena (geography as the study of distribution), 
	+ area studies (places and regions), 
	+ study of the human-land relationship, 
	+ research in the Earth sciences.
4. Modern geography	
	Nonetheless, modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be.
5. Science location
	Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human and the physical science".	
6. Two main branches 	
	Geography is divided into two main branches 
	+ human geography and 
	+ physical geography.[5][6][7]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Sub-fields of geography
	Physical geography (also known as geosystems or physiography) is one of the two major sub-fields of geography.[1][2][3] 
2. Tasks & difference from human geography
	+ Physical geography is that branch of natural science which deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, 
	+ as opposed to the cultural or built environment, the domain of human geography.
3. Spheres
	Within the body of physical geography, the Earth is often split into several spheres or environments, the main spheres being the
	+ atmosphere, 
	+ biosphere, 
	+ cryosphere, 
	+ geosphere, 
	+ hydrosphere, 
	+ lithosphere and  
	+ pedosphere. 
4. Research approach
	Research in physical geography is often interdisciplinary and uses the systems approach.

### 3.1 Tasks
	1. Research various natural geographical elements (climate, topography, hydrology, soils, vegetation and animal world, etc.) characteristics, formation mechanism and development law.
	2. Study the relationship between the various components of the natural geography, between each material recycling and energy transfer
	Of the dynamic process, clarify its change law of development as a whole.
	3. Natural geographical environment and spatial variation, natural geography zoning and land types
	Division and district levels and clarify the nature of various types of features and development of land use direction.
	4. Participate in the evaluation of natural conditions and natural resources.
	5. Research artificial environment (by human interference, control of natural and geographical environment) changes in the characteristics of hair
	Development trends and problems way, the search for more rational use and transformation and remediation methods.

### 4.1 Earth's location in the universe

#### 4.1.1 Universe and celestial
1. Classification
+ stars
+ planets
+ satellites
+ meteors
+ comets
+ nebulae
+ other categories
2. Collections
+ System
+ Galaxy
+ Universe

#### 4.1.2 Sun and the solar system
1. Sun's formation
	+ exploding, short-lived supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.
	+ the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud
	+ nuclear fusion converting hydrogen into helium
